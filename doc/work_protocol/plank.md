Today I worked on implementing the microcontroller-protocol. I felt a bit stuck due to the non continuos memory of std::vector, but in the end I could solve it by using a stack allocated buffer, which recieves its size by a template specifier

## :memo: microcontroller serial communication

Today I implemented a class for serial communication with the micro controller. I faced a few problems with synchronization, timeouts etc.. Altough I wasted a couple of hours, in the end I was successful and the class works just fine.
