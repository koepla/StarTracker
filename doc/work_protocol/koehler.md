Today we worked on creating a first draft of our concept and got a ruff idea on how our microcontroller protocol might work. We also created a GitHub organization and this repository.

Today I tested our first prototype and found that when a heavy camera is mounted there are vibrations when moving. I narrowed it down to the connection between the camera bracket and the stepper motors. Then I improved the camera bracket by adding two 1/4 inch screw holes to hold the stepper motor axises more firmly. That will hopefully eliminate vibrations while turning.
